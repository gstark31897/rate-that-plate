# Rate That Plate
Have you ever been on the road and encountered a rude driver? Or perhaps your experience with another driver was a positive one and you wished you could give them a compliment. Rate That Plate provides an interface which allows authenticated users to leave comments on other driversâ€™ road etiquette based on their license plate number. Users can search, post comments on, and vote (through thumbs up and down) on registered license plates.
